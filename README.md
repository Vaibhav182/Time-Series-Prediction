# Time-Series-Prediction
In this project we used Extra Tree Regresoor Algorithm to predict values of five variables. Extra tree classifier is a derivative of random forest and works in a little more randomized manner. We used it to predict the values of Para 9,10,11,12 and it can be easily seen in the notebook uploaded. Then we made some scatter plots of it corresponding to each variable.
